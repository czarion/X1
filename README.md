This code implements the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm.

How It Works:

The Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is used to solve the TSP.
Initially, the cities are arranged in a random order, and the distance between cities is given as a matrix.
The algorithm explores the solution space by swapping cities and evaluating the new tour distance.
The probability of accepting a worse solution decreases as the temperature cools down.
The process repeats until the maximum number of iterations is reached, or the system reaches a solution.
